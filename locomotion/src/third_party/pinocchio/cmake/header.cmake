#
# This setup CMake to handle headers properly.
#
# 1. The `include` directory in the build and source trees is added to the
#   include search path (see INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES). As always, the build
#   directory has the priority over the source directory in case of conflict.
#
# However you *should not* have conflicting names for files which are both in
# the build and source trees. Conflicting names are filenames which differ only
# by a prefix:
#
# include/a.h vs _build/include/a.h src/a.h     vs src/foo/a.h
#
# ...this files makes a project very fragile as the -I ordering will have a lot
# of importance and may break easily when using tools which may reorder the
# pre-processor flags such as pkg-config.
#
# 1. The headers are installed in the prefix in a way which preserves the
#   directory structure.
#
# The directory name for header follows the rule: each non alpha-numeric
# character is replaced by a slash (`/`). In practice, it means that hpp-util
# will put its header in: ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/hpp/util
#
# This rule has been decided to homogenize headers location, however some
# packages do not follow this rule (dg-middleware for instance).
#
# In that case, CUSTOM_HEADER_DIR can be set to override this policy.
#
# Reminder: breaking the JRL/LAAS policies shoud be done after discussing the
# issue. You should at least open a ticket or send an e-mail to notify this
# behavior.
