# DSP IIR Realtime C++ filter library

An infinite impulse response (IIR) filter library for
Linux, Mac OSX and Windows
which implements Butterworth, RBJ, Chebychev filters
and can easily import coefficients generated by Python (scipy).

The filter processes the data sample by sample for realtime
processing.

It uses templates to allocate the required memory so that
it can run without any malloc / new commands.
Memory is allocated at compile time
so that there is never any risk of memory leaks.

This library has been further developed from Vinnie Falco's
great original work which can be found here:
