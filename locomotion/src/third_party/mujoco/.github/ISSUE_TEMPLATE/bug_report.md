**How to submit a good bug report**

- Are you sure this is a bug? If not, consider using the "Ask for help" or "Feature request" templates.

- Use a clear and descriptive title.

- Make it easy to reproduce the problem.

- Include a ***minimal*** model that demonstrates the problem. If the model is small, include it as inline XML. If it requires binary assets, attach it as a zip file.

- Include a screenshot or video, if relevant.

- Include the following context:
  - Operating system.
  - MuJoCo version (and if the bug is new, the version where it used to work).
  - For Python issues, what bindings are you using (i.e `mujoco`, `dm_control`, `mujoco-py`)?
